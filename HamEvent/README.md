# What is HAM radio

Ham radio operators, also known as amateur radio operators or simply "hams", are individuals who have obtained a license to use radio frequencies for personal, non-commercial purposes. These individuals use various types of radio equipment to communicate with other hams around the world, and they often participate in emergency communications and public service activities.

Ham radio operators often participate in special events that are organized to promote amateur radio and provide an opportunity for hams to communicate with others who share similar interests. Some examples of special events that hams participate in include:
Contests, Field Day, SOTA, WFF, Special Event Stations etc. 

# Special Event Stations - What

These are temporary ham radio stations that are set up to commemorate a particular event or anniversary, such as a historic battle, a famous person's birthday, or a significant scientific discovery. These events often attract a large number of hams who want to make contact with the special event station.

Participating in these special events can be a fun way for hams to test their skills, make new contacts, and promote the hobby of amateur radio to the public.

Participants are interested not only in having a QSO with the special event station but also receiving a memorial/diploma.

# How it works - How

Organizer - The event organizer setups the event with
Description, StartDate/EndDate; Rules; Diploma template

Chased stations - Special event station submits (in real time) log information to the system

# Why?
Help HAMs community. HAM is a hobby that tries to get involved in a lot of public service activities. Special event station events are to commemorate a particular event or anniversary, such as a historic battle, a famous person's birthday, or a significant scientific discovery.
YO2KQT (Ham radio club from Timisoara) has a special event in 2023 promoting TM2023 and such an app would help them generate the diplomas.
